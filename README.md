## Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Keras-contrib installation
-  Run the below command to copy the source code locally (Assuming git is installed)
https://www.github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib.git
- cd keras-contrib
- python setup.py install

Or you can refer to this link https://medium.com/@kegui/how-to-install-keras-contrib-7b75334ab742

## Data Augmentation
 - The dataset consists 100 pairs faces and sketches. 88 pairs were chosen for training set.
 - Each pair is augmented to 200 pairs of face and sketch using transformation, rotation and shearing.
 - Do Data Augmentation with this [notebook](https://github.com/naveenvenk17/Face-Generation-from-Sketch/blob/main/Data%20Augmentation.ipynb)

## GAN
 - The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.

 - GAN model consists of Generator model with 50 layers and Adversary Model with 9 layers.

## Training

 - Start training GAN model with this [notebook](https://github.com/naveenvenk17/Face-Generation-from-Sketch/blob/main/GAN.ipynb)
 - Trained our model for 82 epochs

#### Model Prediction after

## Performance Measurement
 - SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) is used for measuring the similarity between two images.
 - Calculate SSIM and Verification Accuracy (L2-norm) using this [notebook](https://github.com/naveenvenk17/Face-Generation-from-Sketch/blob/main/Compute%20SSIM%20and%20L2-norm.ipynb)

## Testing
Generate single image with this [notebook](https://github.com/naveenvenk17/Face-Generation-from-Sketch/blob/main/Testing.ipynb)
